This project was generated with [Python ](https://www.python.org/) version 3.7.0

I developed this project so simple that its understanding is very simple and has no difficulty.

In designing this project I have used the following libraries: 

  1- numpy
  
  2- scipy
  
  3- matplotlib

  4- opencv

  5- skimage
  
In my project, I only used soubel mask and few morphological operations.
